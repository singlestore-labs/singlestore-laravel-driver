# SingleStore Driver for Laravel

This repository contains a SingleStore Driver for Laravel.

## Install

You can install the package via composer:

```shell
composer require singlestoredb/singlestoredb-laravel
```

## Usage

To enable the driver, head to your `config/database.php` file and create a new entry for SingleStore in your `connections`, and update your `default` to point to that new connection:

```php
[
    'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'singlestore'),

    'connections' => [
        'singlestore' => [
            'driver' => 'singlestore',
            'url' => env('DATABASE_URL'),
            'host' => env('DB_HOST'),
            'port' => env('DB_PORT'),
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE'),
            'username' => env('DB_USERNAME'),
            'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD'),
            'unix_socket' => env('DB_SOCKET'),
            'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
            'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
            'prefix' => '',
            'prefix_indexes' => true,
            'strict' => true,
            'engine' => null,
            'options' => extension_loaded('pdo_mysql') ? array_filter([
                PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => env('MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA'),
                PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES => true,
            ]) : [],
        ],
    ]
]
```

> The SingleStore driver is an extension of the MySQL driver, so you could also just change your `driver` from `mysql` to `singlestore`.

In case you want to store failed jobs in SingleStore, then make sure you also set it as the `database` in your `config/queue.php` file. At which point, you may actually prefer to set `DB_CONNECTION='singlestore'` in your environment variables.

```php
'failed' => [
    'driver' => env('QUEUE_FAILED_DRIVER', 'database-uuids'),
    'database' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'singlestore'),
    'table' => 'failed_jobs',
],
```

## PHP Versions before 8.1

In PHP versions before 8.1, the flag `PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES` results in a bug by which all attributes returned by MySQL (and
SingleStoreDB) are returned as strings.

For example, a table with a column named `user_id` and a type of `int(10)`, if the row value is `5423` we would
get a string like `"5423"` in PHP.

This is a historic and known bug:

- [https://stackoverflow.com/a/58830039/3275796](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58830039/3275796)
- [https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/7b34db0659dda933b1146a0ff249f25acca1d669/UPGRADING#L130-L134](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/7b34db0659dda933b1146a0ff249f25acca1d669/UPGRADING#L130-L134)

The best method to solve this is to upgrade to PHP 8.1 or higher. If that's not possible, [Eloquent's attribute casting](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting) is the next best solution. 

## Migrations

This driver provides many SingleStore specific methods for creating or modifying tables. They are listed below. For more information see the [Create Table](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/data-definition-language-ddl/create-table.html) docs on SingleStore.

### Rowstore Tables

To create a rowstore table, use the `rowstore` method.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->rowstore();

    // ...
});
```

### Reference Tables

To create a reference table, you may use the `reference` method.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->reference();

    // ...
});
```

### Global Temporary Tables

To create a [global temporary table](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/data-definition-language-ddl/create-table.html), you may use the `global` method on the table.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->rowstore();
    $table->temporary();
    $table->global();

    // ...
});
```

You may also use either of the following two methods:

```php
// Fluent
$table->rowstore()->temporary()->global();

// As an argument to `temporary`.
$table->temporary($global = true);
```

### Sparse Columns

You can mark particular columns as [sparse](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/data-definition-language-ddl/create-table.html) fluently by appending `sparse` to the column's definition.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->rowstore();

    $table->string('name')->nullable()->sparse();
});
```

### Sparse Tables

You can mark particular entire tables as [sparse](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/data-definition-language-ddl/create-table.html) fluently by appending `sparse` to the column's definition.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->rowstore();

    $table->string('name');

    $table->sparse();
});
```

### Shard Keys

You can add a [shard key](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/developer-resources/porting-tables-to-singlestoredb-cloud/shard-keys.html) to your tables using the standalone `shardKey` method, or fluently by appending `shardKey` to the column definition.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('name');

    $table->shardKey('name');
});

Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('name')->shardKey();
});

Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('f_name');
    $table->string('l_name');

    $table->shardKey(['f_name', 'l_name']);
});
```

### Sort Keys

You can add a [sort key](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/create-a-database/physical-database-schema-design/procedures-for-physical-database-schema-design/creating-a-columnstore-table.html) to your tables using the standalone `sortKey` method, or fluently by appending `sortKey` to the column definition.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('name');

    $table->sortKey('name');
});

Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('name')->sortKey();
});

Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('f_name');
    $table->string('l_name');

    $table->sortKey(['f_name', 'l_name']);
});

```

### Series Timestamps
To denote a column as a series timestamp, use the `seriesTimestamp` column modifier.

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->datetime('created_at')->seriesTimestamp();

    // Or make it sparse
    $table->datetime('deleted_at')->nullable()->seriesTimestamp()->sparse();
});
```

### Computed Columns

SingleStore does not support virtual computed columns. You must use Laravel's [`storedAs`](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/migrations#column-modifiers) method to create a [persisted computed column](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/create-a-database/physical-database-schema-design/procedures-for-physical-database-schema-design/using-persistent-computed-columns.html).

```php
Schema::create('test', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->integer('a');
    $table->integer('b');
    $table->integer('c')->storedAs('a + b');
});
```

## Testing

Execute the tests using PHPUnit
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To test against an active SingleStore database, create a `.env` file and populate the following variables:

```
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=
```

Now when executing your tests, enable the integration tests by running

```shell
HYBRID_INTEGRATION=1 ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
